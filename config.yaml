    content: |-
      I’m a passionate Mechanical Design Engineer with expertise in robotics, CAD design, prototyping, and precision engineering. I’ve contributed to projects like robotic arms and automation systems, combining SolidWorks, CNC programming, and 3D printing with a strong focus on innovation and functionality. With a proven ability to integrate mechanical systems seamlessly with electronics, I’m driven to create cutting-edge solutions that push technological boundaries.

      My most recent project is a a wheeled-biped robot project, sort of like a clone of Direct Drive's Tita robot or Ascento guard from Ascento Robotics.
