      I am a mechanical design & robotics engineer with a passion for web development. I have a background in computer science and mathematics, and I have a strong interest in the intersection of technology and art. I am currently working as a software developer at [example org.](https://example.com) in San Francisco, CA.

      I am currently working on a wheeled-biped robot project, sort of like a clone of Direct Drive's Tita robot or Ascento guard from Ascento Robotics.
